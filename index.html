        <strong>Leonardo da Vinci </strong> (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) was an
        Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter,
        draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor and architect.
        While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he
        also became known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes
        on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany,
        cartography, painting, and paleontology. Leonardo is among the greatest
        painters in the history of art and is often credited as the founder of
        the High Renaissance. Revered for his technological ingenuity, he
        conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle,
        concentrated solar power, an adding machine and the double hull.
